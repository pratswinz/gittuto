the above will open editable file area where we need to hit insert and give comments for the commit whaterver string




to commit wit insert mode : git commit -m "comment"



files and folders which we do not want to add to the repository or do the commit for those files
create .gitignore file and add the file name which you dont want to add to github


also the same as above you can do with the folders  as well by adding the directory name in .gitignore file like : 
/directoryName 


 can also use wildcards with file extensions and names of files
